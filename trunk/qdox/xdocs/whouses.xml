				<tr>
					<td><nobr><a href="http://www.mockmaker.org">Mock Maker</a></nobr></td>
					<td>
						Mock Maker is a tool for automatically generating mock objects from custom classes to aid in testing the
						untestable. This supports the practises of Test Driven Development and eXtreme Programming.
					</td>
					<td>
						Mock Maker scans the source repository for any class/interface marked with the @mock JavaDoc tag
						and automatically creates the Mock Object for this that matches the class definition.
					</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td><nobr><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/avalon/phoenix">Phoenix</a></nobr></td>
					<td>
						Avalon-Phoenix is a container for containers or a server for servers that is part of Apache's
						Jakarta project.
					</td>
					<td>
						'MetaGenerate' is part of the Phoenix toolset and picks up @phoenix prefixed JavaDoc tags
						to make XML manifests for the components that will be laced together in more XML to make 
						a complete server application.
					</td>
					<td>						
						Testing of MetaGenerate is performed by integration tests that leverate the JUnit framework.
						An end-to-end generation of XML manifests is performed, then checked in test methods against
						expected results.
					</td>
				</tr>

				<tr>
					<td>QDox</td>
					<td>
						This is QDox!
					</td>
					<td>
						QDox requires QDox to build itself! This is because mock objects are used to test QDox and
						MockMaker (see above) is used to build these (which internally uses QDox). To make this possible, a version
						of qdox.jar is bundled with sourcecode to bootstrap the build process. We do like our own dog food.
