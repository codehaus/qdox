    <faq id="Whats_the_object_type_of_an_interface">
      <question>What's the objecttype of an interface?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>The <code><a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/JavaClass.html">JavaClass</a></code> method is used to
			represent both classes and interfaces.
			The <code><a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/JavaClass.html#isInterface()">isInterface()</a></code>
			method allows you to distinguish between the two.</p>

			<p>When using a class, the <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/JavaClass.html#getSuperClass()">getSuperClass()</a>
				return which class is extended. If this has not been defined in the input source code, <code>java.lang.Object</code> is
				returned. When using an interface, this method ALWAYS returns null.</p>

			<p>When using a class, the <a href="apidocs/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/JavaClass.html#getImplements()">getImplements()</a>
			returns an array of the interfaces implemented by the class. If none are implemented, an empty array is returned. When
			using an interface, this returns an array of interfaces the current interface EXTENDS.

    <faq id="Can_I_have_full_control_over_the_classloader">
      <question>Can I have full control over the classloader?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
			I some cases QDox is used to generate classes for another project with it's own dependencies. This could result in class-collission.
			By default the JavadocBuilder will contain the classloader(s) of the current project, but by defining your own classLibrary you can have the required control.
			
			<source>
    /* new ClassLibrary() will give you an empty classLoader
     * Big chance you want at least the system classloader.
     */	
    ClassLibrary classLibrary = new ClassLibrary( ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader() );
    JavaDocBuilder builder = new JavaDocBuilder(classLibrary);
    
      </source>

    <faq id="ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException_500">
      <question>I'm getting an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 500. What to do?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>During the parsing of java files the Parser needs to remember states, which are kept in a stack.
        Due to recursive calls the stack can become very large.
        By default the size of this this stack is 500 and it can only be set during <em>compile-time</em> of QDox.
        Normally 500 per sourcefile will do, but in very, very rare cases this might be too little.
        The only way to increase this number is by rebuilding it.
        Download the <a href="./download.html">sources</a> and build it like <code>mvn install -Dqdox.javaparser.stack=750</code> if you want to change it to 750.
