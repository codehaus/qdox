The bootstrap directory exists, because QDox requires itself to build.

- QDox uses mock objects in its unit tests. 
- The mock objects are generated by MockMaker. 
- MockMaker uses QDox to parse source code to generate mocks.

So bootstrap contains a known to be working version of QDox used only for the mock generation
phase of the QDox build process.
