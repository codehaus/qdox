    <h2>Upgrading to 1.6 or above</h2>
      <p>
        This section describes what needs to be done when upgrading to QDox
        1.5.  For an extensive list of changes (most of them backwards
        compatible), please see the <a href="changes.html">Changes
        Report</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Things that might break your code</h2>
        <p>
          In <a
          href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/JavaClass.html">JavaClass</a>
          the getInnerClasses() method has been renamed to
          getNestedClasses().  The old name remains as a (deprecated)
          synonym.
        </p>
        <p>
          With support for generic types, we've introduced a bug affecting
          the use of "&lt;" and "&gt;" in initialisers (see <a
          href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/QDOX-71">QDOX-71</a>).

    <h2>Upgrading to 1.5</h2>
      <p>
        This section describes what needs to be done when upgrading to QDox

      <h2>Things that might break your code</h2>
        <p>
          The <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/DocletTag.html">DocletTag</a>
          interface no longer contains a setContext() method.  That information is now provided via 
          <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/DocletTagFactory.html">DocletTagFactory</a>, 
          where createDocletTag() now requires an additional "context" parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The parser now passes tag-data to 
          <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/qdox/parser/Builder.html">Builders</a> using a new
          <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/qdox/parser/structs/TagDef.html">TagDef</a> structure.
        </p>

    <h2>Upgrading to 1.3</h2>

            <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/DocletTag.html">DocletTag</a>
            is now an interface and needs to be replaced with
            <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/DefaultDocletTag.html">DefaultDocletTag</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/JavaClass.html">JavaClass</a>
            has changed so that there is no setParent but instead you need to 
            pass the parent into the constructor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/JavaClassParent.html">JavaClassParent</a>
            now has to additional methods that need to be implemented if you implement it:
            <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/JavaClassParent.html#getClassLibrary()">getClassLibrary()</a> and
            <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/qdox/model/JavaClassParent.html#resolveType(java.lang.String)">resolveType(java.lang.String)</a>.
