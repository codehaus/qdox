		<h2>QDox</h2>
			<p>
				QDox is a high speed, small footprint parser for extracting class/interface/method
				definitions from source files complete with JavaDoc @tags. It is designed to be used
				by active code generators or documentation tools.
			</p>
		
		<h2>In A Nutshell</h2>
			<p>
				A custom built parser has been built using <a href="http://www.jflex.de/">JFlex</a>
				and <a href="http://byaccj.sourceforge.net/">BYacc/J</a>.
				These have been chosen because of their
				proven performance and they require no external libraries at runtime.
			</p>
			<p>
				The parser skims the source files only looking for things of interest such as
				class/interface definitions, import statements, JavaDoc and member declarations. The parser ignores things
				such as actual method implementations to avoid overhead (while in method blocks, curly brace counting
				suffices).
			</p>
			<p>
				The end result of the parser is a very simple document model containing enough information to be useful.
